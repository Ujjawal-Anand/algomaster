## About
  Like I have said in the description that its the implementation of some well know algorithms and coding problems in 6 different languages (C,C++,Java,JavaScript,Python and Ruby) It's truly the same.

## Why?
  The main reason behind this project is, I want to learn algorithm,their relationship with datastructure and to learn differnet programming languages by working on something and not just reading some text books ( believe me you are never going to learn anything by just reading those programming books you have to implement it).
